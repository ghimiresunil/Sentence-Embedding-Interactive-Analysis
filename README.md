# Sentence-Embedding-Interactive-Analysis

[Embedding Projector](https://projector.tensorflow.org/) is a free web application which offers commonly three methods ("PCA", "t-SNE", and "custom linear projections") for visaulizing high dimensional data. It includes build-in examples for visualizing word embeddings in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and image processing for MNIST in computer vision.

Question may arise in mind, what is PCA, t-SNE and custom linear? 

- [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis): Principal Component Analysis in short for PCA is often effective at exploring the internal structure of the embeddings, revealing the most influential dimensions in the data.
- [t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding) : t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding in short for t-SNE is useful for exploring local neighborhoods and finding clusters, allowing developers to make sure that an embedding preserves the meaning in the data
- Custom Linear Projection: Help discover meaningful "directions" in data sets - such as the distinction between a formal and casual tone in a language generation model - which would allow the design of more adaptable ML systems.
